    /*
     * Challenge #7:
     * There are many interfaces in Java SDK, and sometimes we can use a lambda expression
     * instead of creating an instance that implements the interface we want to use.
     *
     * Question:
     * Given a specific interface, how we can tell whether we can map a lambda expression to it?
     * What's the criteria that has to be met?
     *
     * Answer:
     * The interface has to be a functional interface. It can have only a single method that must be implemented.
     * A functional interface can contain more than one method, but all the methods but one must have default implementations.
     *
     * Most of the time, the documentation for an interface will state whether it's a functional interface.
     *
     * Question:
     * With that in mind, can we use a lambda expression to represent an instance of the java.util.concurrent.Callable interface?
     * Hint: The callable documentation can be found here: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html
     *
     * Answer:
     * The Callable interface has a single method named call(). So we can use a lambda for it.
     * The documentation states that it's a functional interface.
     *
     * Question:
     * Is the java.util.Comparator interface a functional interface?
     * https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html
     * Yes, despite containing over 10 methods, only one method has to be implemented, compare().
