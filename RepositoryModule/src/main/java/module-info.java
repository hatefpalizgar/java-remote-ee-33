module RepositoryModule {
    exports repository;
}
// Modules in Java, introduced in Java 9.
// It's part of JPMS (Java Module Platform System)
// Benefits of Modules:
// 1. Encapsulation; meaning allows you to specify which part of your code should be exposed
// and which parts should be kept internal
// 2. Improved maintainability; it breaks down a large application into smaller, manageable pieces.
// Each team can be responsible for a module
// 3. Enhanced Security; it allows you to limit the exposure of internal packages/classes to
// unauthorised users
// 4. Read more about that online!
